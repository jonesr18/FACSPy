currently, no check for completely missing comps is in place!
see dataset -> compensate samples

think about setting cofactors for scatter channels to 1...


metadata: add function to rename sample_id to sampleID

Transformer: Implement FMO controls

MFI: implement population parameter

rename uns["gating_cols"] to uns["gates"]


UNIT TESTS!!! especially for cases where inputs are missing

write wrapper function to create supplements


read about flowsom... what about the input parameters?


restrict_to_parameters

write test for contains_fluo_only

test functions for subset stained and unstained

Transformer Class: implement cell number matching
Transformer Class: refactor so that calculation logic becomes somewhat different


BUG: return compensation matrix if none was provided by dataframe
